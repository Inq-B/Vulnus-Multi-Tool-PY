# Vulnus-Multi-Tool

Still a Work in Progress

How to use: Put any map of your choice into the map.txt folder (say if you want to put in an osu map to convert to vulnus, then find the .osu file and paste everything inside that file into map.txt)

please keep in mind that this multi tool is mainly based for the vulnus mapping format, not SS
so stuff like map resizer and offset adjuster is only for vulnus maps only, sorry!!

If you have any questions, dm me.
